# 🍽️ Swiggy Recommendation Model Project

## 📌 About the Project

In this project, I developed a recommendation model for aspiring restaurant owners looking to open a new restaurant in Bangalore using data scraped from Swiggy, a popular food delivery platform. The project involves data extraction, preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms to provide insights and recommendations.

## 📋 Presentation

- Prepared a presentation summarizing the project's objectives, methods, findings, and recommendations.

<br>

## 🌟 Challenges Faced

- **Data Collection**: Gathering and cleaning data from Swiggy required web scraping techniques, handling dynamic content, and managing data quality.

- **Algorithm Complexity**: Developing a recommendation algorithm that considers multiple factors while ensuring scalability and real-time performance was challenging.

- **User Engagement**: Encouraging users to engage with the recommendation system and provide feedback for continuous improvement.

<br>

## 💡 Insights Derived

- **Personalized Recommendations**: The recommendation model provides personalized restaurant suggestions based on user preferences, determines the best location for opening a restaurant.

- **User Engagement**: Analyzing user interactions with recommended restaurants and tracking user feedback helps refine the recommendation algorithm.

- **Restaurant Insights**: By analyzing user preferences, restaurant owners can gain insights into customer preferences, leading to menu optimization and targeted promotions.

<br>

## 🚀 Future Scope

- **Enhanced Personalization**: Incorporate machine learning techniques such as collaborative filtering and deep learning to enhance recommendation accuracy.

- **User Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback mechanism to capture user preferences and continuously update the recommendation model.

- **Geo-Location Integration**: Integrate real-time location data to recommend nearby restaurants and delivery options

- **Market Expansion**: Extend the recommendation system to other cities and regions to reach a broader user base.
