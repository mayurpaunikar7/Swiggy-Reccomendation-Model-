# Swiggy Recommendation Model Project

## About the Project

In this project, I developed a recommendation model for aspiring restaurant owners looking to open a new restaurant in Bangalore using data scraped from Swiggy, a popular food delivery platform. The project involves data extraction, preprocessing, analysis, visualization, and the implementation of machine learning algorithms to provide insights and recommendations.

## Project Details

### Data Extraction

- Utilized Python to scrape data from Swiggy, collecting information in a specified format.
- Gathered restaurant details including cuisine, location, and price information.

### Data Preprocessing

- Cleaned and organized the scraped data for analysis.
- Prepared two tables using NumPy and Pandas for further analysis.

### Machine Learning Algorithms

- Applied RandomForestRegressor and GradientBoostingRegressor models.
- Utilized the models to predict preferred prices and suggest suitable locations.

### Webpage

- Created an interactive webpage for users to input cuisine, preferred location, and preferred price.
- Utilized Flask to build the user interface.
- Stored model predictions using Pickle.

### Power BI Dashboard

- Developed a Power BI dashboard to visualize data insights and model predictions.
- Visualizations include popular cuisine, average price, most popular restaurant, and more.
